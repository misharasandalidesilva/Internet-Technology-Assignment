         <h2><u>Instructions</u></h2>
         <ul>
           <li><b> Prepare the Ingredients:</b></li>
           If you havenâ€™t already, cook 2 cups of jasmine rice according to the package instructions. For the best texture, let the rice cool completely or use leftover rice from the fridge.

           Peel and devein the shrimp if not already done. Pat them dry with paper towels.

           Dice the onion and chop the green onions. Mince the garlic.

           <li><b>Step 2 Cook the Shrimp</b></li>
           In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.

           Add the shrimp to the skillet and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until they turn pink and are cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set aside.

           <li><b>Step 3 Cook the Vegetables</b></li> 
           In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil.

           Add the diced onion and cook until translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.

           Add the frozen peas and carrots to the skillet and cook until they are heated through, about 2-3 minutes.
 
           <li><b>Step 4 Scramble the Eggs</b></li>  
           Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet or wok. Pour the beaten eggs into the empty side and scramble until fully cooked.
           
           Once the eggs are cooked, mix them with the vegetables.

           <li><b>Step 5 Stir-Fry the Rice</b></li>
           Add the cold, cooked rice to the skillet. Break up any clumps and stir-fry for a few minutes until the rice is heated through and well mixed with the vegetables and eggs.

           Return the cooked shrimp to the skillet and mix everything together.

           Add soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) to taste. Drizzle with sesame oil if desired. Stir well to ensure even distribution of the sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

           <li><b>Step 6  Finish and Serve</b></li>
           Stir in the chopped green onions and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.

           Garnish with fresh cilantro or additional green onions if desired.

           Serve the shrimp fried rice hot, either as a main dish or as a side.
