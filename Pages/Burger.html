        A burger, short for hamburger, is a popular and versatile sandwich consisting of a cooked patty, typically made from ground beef, placed inside a sliced bun. 
        Originating in the United States, it has become a global favorite due to its adaptability and the ease with which it can be customized. 
        Classic toppings include lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and cheese, with condiments like ketchup and mustard enhancing flavor. 
        Burgers can be grilled, pan-fried, or broiled and are often enjoyed with a variety of side dishes, making them a staple in casual dining.

                 <h2><u>Instructions</u></h2>
                 <ul>
                   <b>Form the Patty</b>
                         <li> Take the ground beef and gently shape it into a patty. Aim for about 1/2 inch thick. Avoid overworking the meat to keep the burger tender.</li>
                         <li> Season both sides of the patty with salt and pepper.</li>
                
                   <b>Cook the Patty</b>
                          <li>Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. If using a skillet, you might want to add a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
                          <li>Place the patty on the hot skillet or grill. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium doneness. Adjust the cooking time if you prefer your burger rarer or more well-done.</li>
                          <li>If you’re adding cheese, place the slice on the patty during the last minute of cooking and cover with a lid to melt the cheese.</li>

                    <b>Toast the Bun</b>      
                          <li>Split the burger bun and toast the cut sides in a separate pan or under a broiler until golden brown.</li>

                    <b>Assemble the Burger</b>
                          <li> Spread condiments on the bottom half of the bun.</li>
                          <li> Add any desired toppings like lettuce, tomato, or onion.</li>
                          <li> Place the cooked patty (and cheese, if using) on top of the toppings.</li>
                          <li> Finish with any additional condiments or toppings.
                          <li> Place the top half of the bun on the burger.</li>

                    <b>Serve</b>
                           <li>Enjoy your burger with a side of fries, chips, or a salad!</li>

                 <h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>
                 <ul>
                   <b>Prepare the Chicken Patty</b>
                         <li> 
                            In a large bowl, combine the ground chicken, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese (if using), egg, mayonnaise,
                             garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix until everything is well combined.</li> 
                             
                        <li>
                            Divide the mixture into 4-6 portions and shape them into burger patties. 
                            Make sure they are slightly larger than your burger buns, as they will shrink a bit while cooking.</li>
                
                   <b>Bread the Patty</b>
                          <li>
                            Place the flour in one shallow dish, the beaten eggs in another, and the panko breadcrumbs in a third dish.</li>

                          <li>
                            Dredge each patty in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip it into the beaten eggs, and then coat it with the panko breadcrumbs, pressing down lightly to ensure the crumbs adhere well.</li>

                    <b>Cook the Patty</b>      
                          <li>
                            Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. You can test if the oil is hot enough by dropping a small piece of bread into the oil; it should sizzle immediately.</li>

                          <li>
                            Carefully place the breaded patties in the hot oil. Fry for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Ensure the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (74°C).</li>
                           
                          <li>
                            Remove the cooked patties from the skillet and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>

                    <b>Assemble the Burger</b>
                          <li> 
                            If desired, toast the burger buns lightly in the skillet or oven until they are golden brown.</li>

                          <li> 
                            Spread mayonnaise or your favorite burger sauce on the bottom half of each bun. Place a crispy chicken patty on top,
                            followed by lettuce, tomato slices, and pickles. Top with the other half of the bun.</li>

                    <b>Serve</b>
                           <li>Serve the crispy chicken burgers hot with your favorite sides like fries or a salad. Enjoy your delicious, homemade crispy chicken burgers!</li>
